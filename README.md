### Backend API

**GET `/songs`**
- Returns a JSON array of available audio files
- Example: `["song1.mp3", "song2.mp3"]`

**POST `/upload`**
- Accepts multipart form data with audio file
- Saves to `songs/` folder
- Returns upload status

### Data Storage

- **Server-side** — Audio files stored in `songs/` folder
- **Client-side** — Favorite songs stored in browser localStorage under key `musicPlayerFavorites`

## Supported Audio Formats
- MP3
- WAV
- OGG
- M4A
- FLAC
- AAC

## Notes

- Favorites are stored locally in your browser and will persist across sessions
- To share favorites across devices, export from browser DevTools > Application > LocalStorage
- The server dynamically scans the `songs/` folder for available tracks
- No database required — fully serverless on the frontend (except file upload)

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start**
- Ensure port 3000 is not in use: `Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force`
- Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed

**Songs not appearing**
- Check that audio files are in the `songs/` folder
- Verify file extensions are supported (MP3, WAV, OGG, M4A, FLAC, AAC)
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+R)


Enjoy your music! 🎵
